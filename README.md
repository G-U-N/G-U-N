Hi, I am Fu-Yun Wang. I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in machine learning at Nanjing University.

My research interests include `Continual Learning`, `Bayesian Methods`, `Machine Learning Theory` and `Reinforcement Learning`. 

I am currently working on `incremental learning` and  its reliable theoretical explanation.

You can find some of my study notes on [zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/tian-cai-68-16). 
I am busy currently, so I haven't updated much.
